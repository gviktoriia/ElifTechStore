Instructions for Setting up and Running the Application:

Prerequisites:

1. Ensure that you have XAMPP installed on your system. If you don't have it, you can download it from the official XAMPP website: https://www.apachefriends.org.
Make sure you have a compatible web browser (e.g., Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox) installed on your computer.

Also the database is connected locally from phpmyadmin. 

2. Database Setup:

I have used PHPMyAdmin, which comes bundled with XAMPP, to manage the MySQL database on server 3306.
Please use the following database credentials:
  host: 'localhost',
  user: 'root',
  password: '',
  database: 'store',
  
3. For checking the site you should start server and client parts.
First, can be started with command `npm start` in the root of th project.
Frontend part can be started by commands `cd frontend` and `npm start`.
